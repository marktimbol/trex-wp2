					<p class="">
						T Rex General Trading LLC is a multinational trading and distribution company with operations across the European Union, MEA, and Asia specialized in the trade of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, wines, spirits, sparkling water, tobacco, cosmetics and toiletries but not limited to these products. As part of its expansion plans, in early 2012 the company spread out in to the Middle East Africa and Asia; resulting in the shifting of its headquarters from the United Kingdom to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. A strategic move that saw it centralize all its operations like Sourcing, Purchasing, Logistical control, Finance, Sales and Marketing across markets. All decisions relating to day to day functions were shifted to this office to facilitate smooth flow of communication, operations and quicker response time between markets.
